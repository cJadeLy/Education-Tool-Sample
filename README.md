# Education-Tool-Sample
Screen shots were submitted before 11:59pm on 10/19 and reflect the state of the implementation I accomplished. I did not actually finish the full implementation. I will still be making commits becuase I am going to use this tool for myself for my SD paper. Yes I know this tool exists but this was fun and I want it to be specific to [this pdf](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE%20Citation%20Guidelines.pdf) I have been refering to in making my citations. Just Adding this note so you don't see commits after the due date and think I'm tryin' to be slick.

## jpg images 
...are Screen Shots of my views that I renamed..

The default image name was a rediculous filename that made no sense, I wish now I would have named them the same name as the source files but.. yea.

[PatentDetails.jpg](https://github.com/cJadeLy/Education-Tool-Sample/blob/master/PatentDetails.jpg) - this is also index.html, just after the user selects the `Patent` tab
